# Game Development Patterns in Unity

This project demonstrates the implementation of various development patterns in a game created with **Unity**. It was developed as part of the course **Game Engineering** during my third year of university.

### About the Project

The objective of this assignment was to learn and apply several game development patterns and standards while creating a game. The focus was on building the game in an efficient, understandable, and robust manner. The following patterns were implemented in the game:

- **State**
- **Dirty Flag**
- **Object Pool**
- **Flyweight**
- **Observer**
- **Prototype**
- **Singleton**

### Technologies
- **Unity**
- **C#**
